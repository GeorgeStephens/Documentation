title: USB Vendor IDs
---

If your product is accessible/connectable via USB, then you'll need to purchase a USB Vendor ID that uniquely identifies the product as yours. 

# Purchasing a Vendor ID

Vendor IDs are controlled by the [USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF)](http://www.usb.org/) and unfortunately, they are quite expensive ($5,000 one time purchase, or $4,000/year annual fee). 

To purchase a USB Vendor ID click [here](http://www.usb.org/developers/vendor/).

# Identifying your Product

Once you have purchased a Vendor ID, you'll want to make sure it's burned into the One Time Programmable (OTP) memory on your product after you finish board assembly.
