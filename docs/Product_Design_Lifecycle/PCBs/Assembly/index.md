[how assembly works]

 1. Solder paste applied through a silk screen mask
 2. Pick and Place machine places components on solder paste
 3. Hot air reflow machine bakes the board and melts the solder paste to the component pads
 4. Board is flipped and process repeated (if two sided)
 5. Any through hole components are placed and wave-soldered on the bottom (assuming there are no SMD components on the bottom), or soldered by hand (if SMD components on bottom)



# Business Of

[Country of Assembly]

[Lead time]

[supplying your own components vs. assembly house supplying them]

[component audit]

[make sure they're on reels, not cut tape. most suppliers allow you to buy smaller quantities (not a full reel) and will put them on a reel for you]

## Controlling Costs

[Avoid through-hole components]

[purchasing components in quantity, standardize on components]

## Understanding Bids

[NRE charges, Programming charges, Testing, validation]

# Technical Gotchas

[baking ICs to remove moisture]
