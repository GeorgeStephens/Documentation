[can save money; solderable at home]

[cheapest to buy the PCB]

[make one at a time]

[don't use anything smaller than 0402, 0603 is better; you can make smaller later, unless you're pressed for space. smaller components are more difficult, more expensive to get done]

[make sure to check the tolerances and capabilities of the place you'll get them done]


## Debugging
