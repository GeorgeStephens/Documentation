* _Power_ is a term that usually means wattage.
* _Wattage_ (`W`) is a convenience unit to describe electricity that includes amps and voltage, multiplied together (`watts = amps x volts`).
* Volts and amps can be traded for each other in a current, as long as the overall amount of work (Wattage), stays the same. This is often done through induction.

## Power Calculations Derived from Ohm's Law

In addition to the standard definition of a watt (`volts * amps`), power can be calculated when only `volts` or `amps` and `resistance` is known:

 * When amperage (current) and resistance is known: `P = I^2 * R`
 * When voltage (force) and resistance is known: `P = V^2 / R`
