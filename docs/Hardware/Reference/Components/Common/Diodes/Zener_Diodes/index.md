Zener diodes have a known, precise breakdown voltage, which makes them very useful for providing a _reference voltage_.

## Reverse Voltage Ratings

Because Zener diodes are often used as voltage references, they come in a wide variety of reverse voltages. In fact, Zeners cover all common voltages you're likely to find in modern circuits.
