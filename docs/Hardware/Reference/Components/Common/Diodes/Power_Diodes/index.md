Power (aka _rectifier_) diodes are similar to signal diodes but are designed to handle higher current, usually `1A` or more. The [1N4001](https://octopart.com/search?q=1N4001) is a common rectifier diode and is capable of handling `1A`, but the `V`<sub>`f`</sub> (forward voltage) drop is `1.1V`. These are commonly used to protect certain parts of circuits from voltage spikes, as well as for conversion of AC to DC electricity.
