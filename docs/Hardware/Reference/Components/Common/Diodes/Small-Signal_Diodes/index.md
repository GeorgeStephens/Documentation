title: Small-Signal Diodes

Also known as _switching_ diodes, they have an extremely fast `Trr`, and are used for fast current switching.

They are one of the most common diodes available, largely because of their usefulness in high frequency circuits like radios, where their fast switching abilities are required.

They typically have small power ratings, `150mA` or less, and a `V`<sub>`f`</sub> of `0.7V`.
