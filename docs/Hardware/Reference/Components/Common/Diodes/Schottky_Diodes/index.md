title: Schottky Diodes

_Schottky diodes_ use a piece of metal against the N-type side instead of a P-type semiconductor. This results in a much lower voltage drop and fast switching speeds and are oftenused in a clever way to get to a digital `0`/`OFF`. Used for basic logic control.

The circuit symbol for a Schottky diode looks similar to the diode symbol, except that the perpendicular line looks similar to an `S`.

Schottky diodes typically have a very low voltage drop (`V`<sub>`f`</sub>), typically around `0.2V` (`0.15V` to `0.45V`) which makes them very fast and also makes them ideal for use in simple circuit logic.
