We've created these tutorials to help introduce and demistify hardware for folks diving in and confused as to how it all works, and where to start. 

These tutorials are designed to be explored either independently or together. 

* [Introduction to Hardware Design](/Hardware/Fundamentals/Introduction_to_Hardware_Design/) - Start here if you're brand new to the process of creating hardware. It covers the hardware/IoT creation and maintenance lifeycle from a high level and walks through the stages of development, deployment, and maintenance.
* [Electronics Tutorial](Electronics) - If you're totally new to electronics or want to review the fundamentals, check this tutorial out. It's a modern, practical primer on how electricity and modern electronics work.
* [PCB Design Tutorial](PCB_Tutorial) - This is a video tutorial of creating a custom circuit board design and walks through the circuit design, PCB layout, fabricatin, and finally, and prototype assembly in a home lab.
