title: Part 1 - The Physics of Electrical Theory
---

In order to understand how circuits work and how to design them, we must first understand some basic physics. Electrical theory and application comes directly from the structure and forces of atoms. This section dives into the atomic structure of conductors to explore 
what electricity is, and how it works.

# NOTES

 * Electrons orbit the Nucleus in incredibly complex patterns, but at any given time tend to be at a particular distance away from the nucleus. That distance is a predictable distance and is called a shell.
    * this is key to how work is done with electricity
