Now that we understand how to use both N-Channel and P-Channel MOSFETs in both Low-Side and High-Side switching circuits from a conceptual perspetive, let's dig into the technical specifications and details of MOSFETs that will aid us in finding appropriate parts for our circuits.


[talk about the VGS, RDSON, etc. and the practicailities of how to choose MOSFETs]
