### Meadow
[Api reference for all things Meadow](./Meadow/), Meadow.Cloud, Meadow.Hardware, Meadow.Logging, and much more.

### Meadow.Foundation
The [Meadow.Foundation](/Meadow/Meadow.Foundation/Peripherals/) peripherals library is an open source repository of drivers and libraries that streamline and simplify adding hardware to your .NET Meadow IoT application.

Meadow.Foundation makes the task of building connected things easy with Meadow by providing a unified driver and library framework that includes drivers and abstractions for common peripherals such as: sensors, displays, motors, cameras and more. Additionally, it includes utility functions and helpers for common tasks when building connected things.

Below is a quick reference to different Meadow.Foundation guides.
