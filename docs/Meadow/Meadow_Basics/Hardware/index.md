The Meadow F7 is a workhorse Wi-Fi and Bluetooth enabled System-on-Module (SoM) microcontroller-based board designed for sophisticated IoT applications and is based on the STMicroelectronics STM32F7 microcontroller (MCU) with an Espressif ESP32 coprocessor.

The Meadow F7 is provisioned with Meadow.OS which runs full .NET Standard v2.1 applications and can be managed remotely via Meadow.Cloud with secure, over-the-air (OtA) updates, reliable push messaging, and device and application health monitoring over a Wi-Fi or ethernet (F7 Production model only) network.

## Form-Factors

The Meadow F7v2 System-on-Module (SoM) is available in two models, based on two differing form factors:

* **Meadow F7v2 Feather Development Module** - An Adafruit Feather specification compatible design, intended for development, prototyping, and low-volume (1,000 or less) production.
* **Meadow F7v2 Core-Compute Module** -  A surface mount device (SMD) intended for high-volume and industrial production, the F7 Production also adds Ethernet and SD card capabilities.
