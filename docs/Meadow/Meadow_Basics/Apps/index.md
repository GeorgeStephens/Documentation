# Meadow Applications

Meadow projects are built as .NET framework class libraries, but the code is executed like an application on the Meadow hardware.

## Meadow Package

When you create a new Meadow application, the `Meadow` core package should be automatically added. It can be manually installed via NuGet:

```console
> nuget install Meadow
```

## `App` Class

The main Meadow application class should inherit [Meadow.App](/docs/api/Meadow/Meadow/App%60D%60/), which provides a way for Meadow OS to notify the application of system events, such as going to sleep or waking up. Meadow will scan your application assembly for a class that implements `IApp` and launch that automatically.

The `App` declaration requires a generic parameter, `D`, representing the device type. For `D`, you'll need to pass a `Meadow.IDevice` that represents the board you're using. For example, if your app class is called `LEDApp`, and you're using a Meadow Feather v2 board, your `LEDApp` declaration would look like the following:

```csharp
public class LEDApp : App<F7FeatherV2>
```

If you're using a Feather v1 board, you'll use this signature:

```csharp
public class LEDApp : App<F7FeatherV1>
```

### `D` = Device

Specifying the `D` parameter sets the current device so that it can be accessed via the [`Device`](/docs/api/Meadow/Meadow/IMeadowDevice/) property of the `IApp`:

```csharp
var redLED = new DigitalOutputPort(Device.Pins.OnboardLEDRed, false);
```

### Accessing your running App, Device, or Log

If you need access to the currently running Meadow App, Device, or Log, you can access those via the [`Resolver`](/docs/api/Meadow/Meadow/Resolver/) class.

```csharp
MyApp myApp = Resolver.App;
```

Therefore, any public members are also available without having to cast. For instance, if your app class had a property called `InstalledName`, it could be accessed as follows:

```csharp
var name = Resolver.App.InstalledName;
```

For more detailed information, check out the [Resolver documentation](/Meadow/Meadow.OS/Resolver).

## Configure Meadow, wi-fi, and application settings

Several aspects of your Meadow hardware and application execution are handled by configuration files that you can deploy with your app. Learn more about these configuration files and options from the [Meadow Configuration details](/Meadow/Meadow.OS/Configuration).

## Sample Meadow Application

Here is a complete example of an application that cycles through several colors on the onboard LED:

```csharp
// Change F7FeatherV2 to F7FeatherV1 for V1.x boards
public class MeadowApp : App<F7FeatherV2>
{
    RgbPwmLed onboardLed;

    public override Task Initialize()
    {
        Resolver.Log.Info("Initialize hardware...");

        onboardLed = new RgbPwmLed(device: Device,
            redPwmPin: Device.Pins.OnboardLedRed,
            greenPwmPin: Device.Pins.OnboardLedGreen,
            bluePwmPin: Device.Pins.OnboardLedBlue,
            CommonType.CommonAnode);

        return base.Initialize();
    }

    public override Task Run()
    {
        CycleColors(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1000));
        return base.Run();
    }

    void CycleColors(TimeSpan duration)
    {
        Resolver.Log.Info("Cycle colors...");

        while (true)
        {
            ShowColorPulse(Color.Blue, duration);
            ShowColorPulse(Color.Cyan, duration);
            ShowColorPulse(Color.Green, duration);
            ShowColorPulse(Color.GreenYellow, duration);
            ShowColorPulse(Color.Yellow, duration);
            ShowColorPulse(Color.Orange, duration);
            ShowColorPulse(Color.OrangeRed, duration);
            ShowColorPulse(Color.Red, duration);
            ShowColorPulse(Color.MediumVioletRed, duration);
            ShowColorPulse(Color.Purple, duration);
            ShowColorPulse(Color.Magenta, duration);
            ShowColorPulse(Color.Pink, duration);
        }
    }

    void ShowColorPulse(Color color, TimeSpan duration)
    {
        onboardLed.StartPulse(color, (duration / 2));
        Thread.Sleep(duration);
        onboardLed.Stop();
    }
}
```
