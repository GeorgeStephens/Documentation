subtitle: Understanding and switching between the onboard and external antenna options.

Both the Meadow F7 Feather development board and Core-Compute Module have an onboard ceramic chip antenna and a U.FL connector for an external antenna for the 2.4GHz WiFi and Bluetooth radio. Additionally, there is a software antenna switch for toggling between the two antenna; by default, the chip antenna is selected, and you must use the Meadow.OS device API to switch to the external antenna.

## Determining the Currently Selected Antenna

The current antenna in use is available via the device's `CurrentAntenna` property. For example, the following code will write which antenna is currently in use to the console output:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"Current antenna in use: {Device.CurrentAntenna}");
```

## Switching the Antenna

Likewise, switching the antenna is also available via the device. Use the `SetAntenna()` method to change the current antenna:

```csharp
Device.SetAntenna(AntennaType.External);
```
