  "description": "The most effective way to learn PCB design is to actually design and build one. So that's what we'll do. In this multipart tutorial, we're going to design and build a PCB that is a partial version of Clima that includes  BME280 to track temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure, and get its power from a solar power input. In the end, you'll come away with a general grasp of PCB design from start to finish.",
