  "description": "Meadow.Foundation incorporates an architecture that was designed to extend peripheral support seamlessly across expansion peripherals such as I2C/SPI/etc. I/O expansion chips. For example, you can connect an MCP23x or 74x595 I/O expansion chip to a Meadow, and then drive a Relay via one of the pins on the expansion chip, just as if it were connected directly to the Meadow board!",
